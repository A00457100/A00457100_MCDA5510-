Hi, My name is Murali krishna Tulluri. I have more than 10 years experience in the software industry. 
I have experience working as data engineer and data analyst in various projects. Worked for clients like Apple and eBay. 
I lived and worked in the United States for 6 years. I am looking forward to learning skills that would enable me to advance my career further.
I have not worked on the technologies like .NET, Java or C#, but I studied them during my bachelors and if I refresh the knowledge on these then I should be able to write programs using these technologies.
